                        in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy.  This will not impact the lawfulness of any processing based on consent prior to its 
                        withdrawal.

                        You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection authority in your jurisdiction if you believe that a violation of 
                        applicable data protection law in your jurisdiction has occurred.

                        Your personal information may be transferred to recipients (including third party service providers) in countries other than the country in which 
                        the information originally was collected.  Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided 
                        the information.  When your information is transferred to recipients in other countries (such as the U.S.), it will be protected as described in 
                        this Privacy Policy and we will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal information 
                        to recipients in countries other than the one in which you provided the information.
